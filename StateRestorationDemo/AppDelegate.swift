    // MARK: - State Restoration Opt-In

    /*
     *  Unless these methods return YES, the application's state is not saved/restored, no
     *  matter what you do elsewhere. Consider it a global switch.
     *
     *  You might want to return `false` conditionally in application(_:shouldRestoreApplicationState:)
     *  after app updates that include changes to the view (controller) hierarchy and other, potentially
     *  restoration-breaking changes.
     *
     *  Returning `true` in application(_:shouldSaveApplicationState:) will create a restoration
     *  archive ("data.data") which you can inspect using the `restorationArchiveTool` provided by Apple:
     *
     *  https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ (Login required; search for "restoration")
     *
     *  Opting into state restoration will also take a snapshot of your app when entering
     *  background mode.
     *
     *  While this generally switches on restoration, it doesn't do much yet: Individual
     *  controllers, views, and other participating objects must implement basic saving/
     *  restoration mechanisms in order for anything to actually restore. This can be
     *  done in code, or with the help of Storyboards. This demo focusses on code.
     *
     *  General debugging tips:
     *
     *  To get the app to restore in the simulator, follow these steps:
     *
     *  - send the app to the background (home button / cmd + h)
     *  - quit the app in Xcode
     *  - relaunch the app
     *
     *  Do not force-quit the app in the app switcher - this deletes the restoration archive.
     *  Do not kill the app while still in the foreground, as the restoration archive is created
     *  when the app goes into the background. To debug state restoration on device, read the
     *  documentation provided with the `restorationArchiveTool` mentioned above.
