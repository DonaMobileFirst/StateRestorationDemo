# Motivation

+ iOS terminates background apps at (rather) random times
+ State restoration: Trying to hide from the user that the app had been terminated
+ Goal: Re-opening an app that was terminated by the system should equal the experience of switching to an app that awakes from the background
    + **Note:** Full restoration is not always possible or even desirable, e.g., temporary alerts
    
---

# Implementation

+ Roadmap:
    + Opting into state restoration
    + Restoring view controllers (and their hierarchy)
    + Restoring fine-grained state

---

# Implementation

+ Sample project: <br />[github.com/shagedorn/StateRestorationDemo](https://github.com/shagedorn/StateRestorationDemo)
    + Start tag: `NO_STATE_RESTORATION`
    
![right, fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shagedorn/StateRestorationDemo/master/Presentation/app_screenshot.png)
  
+ **Note:** Swift has evolved quickly, so only `master` will build with the latest tools, not the intermediary tags.

---

# Implementation: Opting In

+ Opt-In in the app delegate:

```swift  
func application(_:shouldSaveApplicationState:) -> Bool
```
+ A restoration archive file named `data.data` with global app information (version, timestamp, interface idiom,...) will be created

```swift
func application(_:shouldRestoreApplicationState:) -> Bool
```
+ Consider returning `false` in `shouldRestoreApplicationState` after app updates

---

# Implementation: Opting In

+ iOS takes a snapshot before the app goes into the background
    + Snapshot replaces `Default.png` (or launch Nibs/Storyboards) if at least one view controller supports state restoration
    
+ Tag: `STATE_RESTORATION_OPT_IN`

---

# Implementation: View Controller

+ Per-controller opt-in: set the `restorationIdentifier` property
    + Either in code, or Storyboard/Nib
+ **Done: State preservation**
    + Per view controller, a path of restoration identifiers will be saved
+ **`TODO`: State restoration**
+ Tag: `RESTORATION_IDENTIFIERS`

---

# Implementation: View Controller

+ View controller restoration (options):
    1. Controller sets `restorationClass` to a class that implements `UIViewControllerRestoration`
    1. App delegate instantiates controllers on demand
    1. Implicit: Controller has already been created before state restoration begins
    1. Implicit: Preserved controller had been instantiated from a storyboard

---   

# Implementation: View Controller

+ **Note:** State restoration is attempted in the order defined above, but in the following slides, the various mechanisms have been re-ordered by increasing complexity, and to follow the sample app.

---    

# Implementation: View Controller

+ Restoration option:
    + **Implicit: Controller has already been created before state restoration began**
    + Call order:
          1. `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`
          1. State restoration
          1. `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`

---

# Implementation: View Controller

+ Demo app's state at `BASIC_STATE_RESTORATION` tag:
	+ Initial controllers (tabs one and two) are restored implicitly, including tab selection (we get that for free from `UITabBarController`)
    + View controllers that are created later (city detail) are not restored
    + State of the controllers (e.g., slider value) is not restored

---

# Implementation: View Controller

+ Restoration option:
    + **Set a `restorationClass`**
    + E.g., set the controller as its own restoration class
    + Implement `UIViewControllerRestoration` protocol, and create the controller on demand:

```swift  
 class func viewControllerWithRestorationIdentifierPath(_:coder:)
 -> UIViewController?
```

---

# Implementation: View Controller

+ Restoration option: Set a `restorationClass` (continued)
    + Opt-out/abort: return `nil` from `viewControllerWithRestorationIdentifierPath
    (_:coder:)`
    + `coder` parameter allows informed decision about whether or not to restore
    + Tag: `RESTORATION_CLASS`

---

# Implementation: View Controller

+ Restoration option:
    + **App delegate creates controllers on demand**, similar to `UIViewControllerRestoration` protocol at controller level

```swift  
func application(_:viewControllerWithRestorationIdentifierPath:
coder:) -> UIViewController? 
```

+ `return nil`: In contrast to `UIViewControllerRestoration`, this does *not* cancel implicit restoration
+ Not used in the sample app

--- 

# Implementation: State

+ Restoring fine-grained state: `UIStateRestoring` protocol

```swift
override func encodeRestorableStateWithCoder(coder: NSCoder)  {
    super.encodeRestorableStateWithCoder(coder)
    // Make sure not to access explicitly-unwrapped outlets directly: 
    // May be called when the controller (e.g., in a tab) has never loaded its view
    coder.encodeFloat(slider?.value ?? 0.5, forKey: "encodingKeySlider")
}
override func decodeRestorableStateWithCoder(coder: NSCoder)  {
    super.decodeRestorableStateWithCoder(coder)
    slider.value = coder.decodeFloatForKey("encodingKeySlider")
}
```

+ Encode/decode primitive values or other objects that implement state restoration

---

# Implementation: State

+ `decodeRestorableStateWithCoder(_)` is called after `viewDidLoad()`
+ Restoration (of the view controller itself) cannot be cancelled at this point
+ Any object can implement `UIStateRestoring`, but views and controllers do automatically, and are registered by the system (see `UIStateRestoring` documentation for details)
+ Tag: `STATE_ENCODING`

---
 
# Debugging

+ State preservation is triggered when app enters the background
    
+ Restoration archive is deleted when...
    + Restoration fails or the app crashes
    + User force-quits the app in the app switcher
        + Can be disabled with a developer mode profile
        + Simulator: Quitting the app from Xcode (when in the background) does not delete the archive

---

# Debugging

+ State information is stored in `data.data` files
    + Binary PLISTs: Use `plutil` or `restorationArchiveTool` to read & debug the archives
    + [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) -> Log in and search for "restoration"
        + `restorationArchiveTool` and documentation
        + `Debug Logging` iOS profile
        + `Developer Mode` iOS profile
        
---

# Debugging

+ Tip: Save a Finder search for `data.data` within the simulator directory in your Finder sidebar
+ Usage: `restorationArchiveTool path/to/data.data`

---

# Debugging

+ Debug Logging profile: very verbose, including time profiling

+ "`Warning: Unable to create restoration in progress marker file`"
    + `data.data` archive could not be found, i.e., state preservation failed
    
![right, fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shagedorn/StateRestorationDemo/master/Presentation/log_example.png)

---

# Debugging

+ "`Can't find Child View Controller at index 1 with identifier TabController/:[1]:/NavigationController/:[1]:/_TtC20StateRestorationDemo18CityViewController, truncating child array`"
    + Controller that was stored in the archive could not be restored

---

# GOTCHAs/Tips

+ "Setting" the `restorationIdentifier` by overwriting the getter instead of setting the variable property does not work 
    + Enables state preservation: `data.data` is fine
    + Restoration fails
    	+ My guess: The object is registered for state restoration in `didSet`

---

# GOTCHAs/Tips

+ Not all subviews are included in the snapshot image, e.g., alerts
    + Strive for consistency between the snapshot and what you restore
    + Don't restore temporary errors that (hopefully) have become stale in the meantime, e.g., connection errors
    + Ignore snapshot:

```swift  
UIApplication.sharedApplication().ignoreSnapshotOnNextApplicationLaunch()
```
---

# Tips

+ The main window does not have to be preserved explicitly, but doing so adds extra information, such as, size classes, to the archive

    + Tag: `SIZE_CLASSES`
